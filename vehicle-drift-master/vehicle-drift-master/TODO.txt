############## Overview ##############
The baseline goal of this project is to implement a controller that will use a single equilibrium point to stabilize the vehicle dynamics around. We could go beyond this by recomputing new equilibria according to the desired trajectory. 

In order to implement this baseline functionality, we are simply hard-coding the equilibrium values. 


############## TODO ##############

(1) Debug the controller
	- Implement inverse fiala model
	- What is FyR in Mode 1? 

(2) Model / compute the actual vehicle trajectory. Right now we're just computing the trajectory of the state (r, beta, Ux)

(3) Debug imaginary numbers in dynamics / control when computing forces on friction circle
